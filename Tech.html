<P>INSERT IMAGE</P>
<h2 class="western" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing devices (Vignesh)</strong></span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>What does it do? </strong></span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Makey Makey and Beaglebone are different variants of the single board computer that have become popular in the last decade. In the first half of the 2010&rsquo;s the Raspberry Pi foundation, a UK based charity looked to educate people other than the conventional IT gurus; give the general public access to computing and engineering gadgets which will facilitate both easier access to computing education but also make it easier to find innovate faster if the technology reaches the majority and find that genius hiding amongst us. It the vision that why solve a problem or innovate with a few hundred thousand computing geniuses when there&rsquo;s a potential pool of 7 billion people and counting to lead to you the future goals quicker and maybe even further.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">There have been many variants and competitions to Raspberry Pi since its launch in 2012. It has developed a simple 700 MHz CPU with 256 MB RAM to the current model with 1.4 GHz CPU and 1 GB RAM. As you can note that the specifications of the current Raspberry Pi is more or less equivalent to a lower power computer used by many these days. This is the purpose of Raspberry Pi, it is designed as a fully functioning, cheap computer that runs Linux operating system with several general purpose input and output enabling its user to control several electronic components that are connected to it such as a keyboard and a monitor. The best thing of all is that it cost now to own the latest variant </span></span><span style="color: #080e14;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Raspberry Pi Zero W is around $10, with a little bit of skill, knowledge and bunch of YouTube videos </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">even a high school students or just a keen hobbyist can turn it into a small scale computer with a few other parts. pick up computing as a hobby for a low cost. Millions have been using the Raspberry Pi as a way to learn low level programming, build hardware projects that doesn&rsquo;t exist yet, build a system to automate tasks at home and much more. There are reports of several industries using these single board computer technologies to automate taking it from just mere educational and leisure purpose to industrial money making gem.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The Beaglebone is a like for like competitor for Raspberry Pi but not until recently their products were slightly more expensive compared to Raspberry Pi probably because of the lack of publicity and popularity that it has received. Whereas Arduino and Makey Makey are slight more different to the other two described above. The Arduino and makey makey are microcontrollers that look similar to Raspberry Pi and Beaglebone but they are not as powerful. They also lack the vast variety of input-output ports required to make it a fully working low powered computer. Arduino is generally used for simple tasks such as finding the temperature out and inform the user whether or not to water their garden. Whereas Raspberry Pi and the likes can do that plus connect to the internet figure out the full weather stats, connect to the watering system and perform the tasks remotely with full automation and then reset to original. Makey Makey was made with the idea of education and fun; it&rsquo;s taking the fun part to the next level. It's simple concept is to take everyday things and then connect the microcontroller (board) with things like bananas and other things that conduct using crocodile wires and being able to use it as though it&rsquo;s a gaming controller or as musical keyboard. It promotes the science and computing in an enjoyable way to gain more interested parties rather than showing 1000 lines of code to a student on the first day and scaring them away.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The future of these is pretty much here. These microcontrollers/single-board computers are taking the world by storm. Huge companies like Samsung and Apple have to compete with brands like OnePlus because they are leaning towards these low cost boards which are capable for doing what computers do for a fraction of the price. In 3 years, maybe the phones might become significantly more advanced and cheaper, these small computers might be in every phone or maybe the continual inspiration of younger generation to get into computing is the future and also the legacy these devices will leave behind.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The technology is advancing so fast both because of these microcontrollers and single-board computers like Raspberry Pi but also for these devices. These devices are promoting computing as a favourable and fun possible career path. This has increased not only the bright minds in the industry by also dropped the price of electronic devices due to increases sales. The cheaper the electronic components that make up these devices the more they are used and the cheaper they because. It&rsquo;s a cycle that works for the best.</span></span></p>
<h3 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>What is the likely impact? </strong></span></span></h3>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The impact that these devices has since its creation is the one that its had one the current generation of new computer graduates and the ones that are in high school aspiring to become one. Not just changing the perspective of how they view this field, from finding it challenging enough to put them off to now where they are motivated by that very same challenge because it's fun at the same time. At the same time, experienced computer experts were found to not really have practice understanding of the devices they were so-called experts for after a study was conducted at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. So to provide them with an in-depth practical experience and understanding, the creator found Raspberry Pi as a revolutionary idea.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The satisfaction of the fact that the user creates his own working instrument capable of a lot of things appeal to millions. It also gives a better understanding of other gadgets around them which like most computing or electronic technology is relatively similar. Also getting to familiarise yourself with these technology from an early age helps increase their problem solving, logical thinking and innovative thinking. Like the age old proverb, practice makes perfect.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Its is possible that the change can be seen in the future generations that have grown up with this technology. The change can be positive and lead to a generation full of technology experts and have many innovations in a short span of time. This can also be negative as it can lead to many other health related issues due to excessive use of keyboards or eye strain from the 10&rsquo;s of screens we are exposed to on a daily basis.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">There is also a strong possibility that jobs such as a simple computer administrator that we see at most firms can become reductant as everyone will be an expert in this field due to their evolved aptitude or knowledge. But this can also create tonnes of opportunity for result from the evolution of mankind from these technologies.</span></span></p>
<h3 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>How will this affect you?</strong></span></span></h3>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In my daily life, I started off not appreciating technology because I believed they were out of reach for a simple man, one with a moderate income family household. The computers used to be a thing for pretty much people from royalty. Now there&rsquo;s no house or a person without one or maybe 2 computers. Similarly, I found that these devices spark my interest in tweaking, learning and exploring about gadgets and technology. The Arduino especially has been my favourite. I have created several things like modelling bionic ear, RC cars, temperature and humidity controller, may other sensors that provide warning and also used FPGA board to create a calculator. These continue to blow my mind as to how much these tiny devices are capable of and teaches me new things about electronics and computing all the time. The future for me with these devices are that I&rsquo;ll continue to explore of more of these gadgets as they become more and more accessible to common person like myself. As I&rsquo;m doing a bachelor in IT, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be exposed to these either through assignments or a reference/reminder of these through lessons is enough for me to just get back into playing with these devices. </span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I hope that they continue to develop these and maybe someday I have an idea that&rsquo;s worth sharing with the world and making people&rsquo;s life more comfortable. The idea that these devices can change perspectives is remarkable, it changed mine and I hope my sister and my friends and possibly many others can share it with me through the project we hope to complete. These devices are just as much about inspiring as they are about learning and creating small fun little gadgets that brings out the creative and artistic side in most of us, these should be the focus when technology is introduced to future generations.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Natural language processing &amp; chatbots (Alessio)</strong></span></span></p>
<h3 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>What does it do?</strong></span></span></h3>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Natural language processing is a technology which in short enables computers to be able to process sound and process the words spoken to be interpreted. Natural language processing or NLP as it is referred to is the cornerstone technology that powers voice assistant software acting as a bridge between the diverse languages of the world and the structured approach followed by computers.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The current state of NLP is rather advanced and on the verge of being able to communicate effectively. At this point in time the technology is in the process of learning from data models in order to be able to understand and as a result communicate.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">There are a number of innovative applications for the technology currently in use today with the most widespread been smart voice assistants such as Siri which are able to understand a range of vocabulary and different languages as well as their accents.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style	="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Other uses for the technology include applications to convert speech to text with a notable example being the Dragon dictation software which is capable of converting your voice to text in a reasonably accurate way to quickly write documents. NLP is also in use across many different chatbot applications used by ecommerce operators to act as a means to streamline customer support queries.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">By analysing the words a user types the chatbot can instantly reply with a templated response with the answer to the query if it was asked before or point to the user to relevant resources. Chatbots are currently an area where the technology has been employed on a large scale as they can often save time for both users and companies and pick up slight variations of the same question.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Other areas where the technology is already actively used is voice search across the most popular search engines which are still restricted in functionality at this stage however satisfy most search queries and user intent.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In the near future the ability of both chatbots and NLP will be improved dramatically as larger datasets become available to train the machine learning algorithms that underpin NLP to be more accurate and better determine the intent behind queries and actions. For example if a user starts typing keywords such as problem in an input box then a chatbot may open up offering assistance to the user with their problem.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">As large technology companies begin to utilize the vast troves of user data in combination with neural networks and other algorithms followed by the increasing power of processors and devices the level of accuracy and learning potential will be significantly improved.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Other factors that will be pivotal in the development of NLP technology will be the trend of automation and efficiency which can be gained from using these systems. As the technology will improve and applied to more industries and cost savings are realized then the adoption cost will decrease and more businesses will embrace NLP making it more widespread than ever.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Other factors which will aid in the development of NLP and chatbots will be the technique of &ldquo;stemming&rdquo; which has gradually been perfected and improved by engineering teams. Essentially the purpose of stemming is the process of taking multiple words and stripping them down to a root phrase which accurately describes all the words and their meanings. This process significantly reduces the performance overhead of NLP as rather than processing a large number of words that all mean the same thing can be consolidated into root phrases which are far easier for software to process and require less storage and processing power.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Lastly the biggest improvement to NLP and chatbots in my opinion will be storage technology and internet speeds which will allow larger datasets to be applied for machine learning algorithms to learn over time and improve their effectiveness in a much faster fashion. </span></span></p>
<h3 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>What is the likely impact? </strong></span></span></h3>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">There are a number of potential impacts that will arise as NLP technology evolves and improves will continue to grow and surface in areas that weren&rsquo;t present before. The biggest shift likely to happen as a result of NLP is the rearrangement of customer service personnel particularly for ecommerce websites and other transactional marketplaces.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This change will see less customer support staff been employed as they will no longer be required due to the automation provided by chatbots to quickly answer repetitive or already answered common questions. I don&rsquo;t believe they will make support staff redundant as new unique issues will always surface in different fields however NLP will replace many of these employees.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Other people likely to be affected by NLP are customer service &amp; serving personnel in the takeaway food market. With many orders now coming in through food delivery applications many of which are chatbot enabled such as Pizza Hut&rsquo;s voice assistant the number of staff will be reduced and may eventually make these staff jobs redundant.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Other domains affected by NLP technology include personal assistants in office environments, many voice enabled applications are capable of setting reminders, sending templated emails, out of office replies, leaving messages as well as scheduling emails to name a few features. We are also seeing voice assistants improve dramatically and even make phone calls on their own to book appointments in a Google I/O demonstration. While this is still a couple of years away in the near future when costs come down and the accuracy is improved then personal assistant staff will likely decline as less staff are needed.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Whilst these changes will impact many jobs they will also create some new ones and change the way others conduct their work. For example search engine companies like Bing will likely require less search engine raters as voice search is more tightly integrated into search however this will create new demand for voice engineers.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Another example of jobs that will be created are for chatbot developers who will be responsible for creating and maintaining these bots to ensure they continue to aid users in their various tasks.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Lastly many technologies that rely on manual data import such as CRM software and customer experience call recording. NLP technologies will be able to analyze voice tones and raise flags for human staff to identify cases of customer dissatisfaction. NLP technologies will also be able to automate the process of extracting data such as names and contact numbers before importing them into a CRM. </span></span></p>
<h3 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>How will this affect you? </strong></span></span></h3>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The use of NLP in its current form has a limited impact on my life however going forward I believe it will play more of a role in my personal life as well as family and friends. The first area which I believe will be affected is my interaction with customer support queries. Some of the online services I use have implemented chatbots for their support systems which is a trend I think will continue and thus change the way I interact with support questions.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Other factors that I would be affected is semantic search which has already been implemented by all major search engines. Semantic search will better understand complex data and user intent when searching for different phrases. This will make search generally faster and more efficient for both myself and those around me. While semantic search will help it may also limit some information I would find if the websites aren't optimized for this approach meaning I could miss out on useful resources.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">NLP technology will also affect my writing workflow as applications like Grammerly and built-in grammar checkers will improve making writing far quicker and more efficient. This will also help everyone with their writing however will likely amplify the problem of over reliance meaning without it people will struggle to spell correctly or use proper grammar.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Another aspect of life which would change as a result of NLP technologies will be individual privacy. As large companies utilize the technology more with their vast troves of data the level of ad targeting and profiling will only get better and mean that user privacy will be at greater risk making it hard for people to remain private.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This can also bring about other challenges like censorship which would be easier to implement with NLP keyword matching and other issues like filter bubbles based on instant recommendations which would affect everyone.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">As I am interested in software development NLP technology will likely influence some of my future programs as I incorporate this functionality to streamline different tasks. </span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">All up I believe NLP technology will make many tasks easier and more streamlined but also introduce new challenges as mentioned above which will affect friends, family and those around me. </span></span></p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Our Project Idea&nbsp;</strong></h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team proposed to design a humidity and temperature monitor using the Arduino kit. The project will utilise the Arduino nano microprocessor and the small electrical components such as LCD unit for displaying the temperature and humidity to its user, temperature sensor, humidity sensor, 9V battery pack available off-the-shelf at JAYCAR electrical goods store. All the components will be assembled using the prototyping breadboard and small connector cables to all for easy assembly. The code to run the components will be coded on Arduino IDE and then uploaded on to the microprocessor, the expected battery life is up to 2 weeks.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Motivation:</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The motivation behind this simple project is education. Although the project is simple enough for a team to build within a reasonable amount of time, the goal of this project is to educate high school children and get them excited about information technology and software/hardware engineering. The temperature and humidity monitor are interactive and easy for high school children to build over a few sessions which will allow them to gain an appreciation for technology and help guide the interested children to science and technology pathway. With this project we hope to expose the high school children to minor coding, configuring small electrical components and make it a team building activity.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Description:</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The temperature and humidity monitoring system which is build using the Arduino system will have 2 electrical components &ndash; 1 monitoring the temperature and 1 humidity sensor which will monitor the humidity around the sensor. Both these sensors will send their readings to the Arduino at a specified item (e.g. 0.5 sec) and the Arduino will then process this information using a set of formulae. The reason the inputted data needs to be processed is because the electrical components sending the readings are simply voltage read-outs which change depending on the temperature or humidity around it. This voltage needs to be converted into an easy to read temperature value (degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit) or humidity value (in percentage). Once the processor converts these values, then it&rsquo;s outputted to the LCD unit which displays the date. There are several things that need to be considered when programming the LCD unit, as the data comes into the LCD unit the format needs to be appropriate, the contract and brightness of the screen needs to be adjusted so that the values are clearly visible to the reader but also not too bright or high in contrast that the battery gets drained quickly.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the software side of the project is complete, then the hardware can be assembled. Ensure that all the components are available before beginning. Next the components need to be connected in series so that they are all linked to each other. This allows for a constant flow of information between the sensors and the screen. Once all the parts are connected correctly, upload the code to the processor and then connect the battery terminals in the correct spots. After a few seconds the system should be self-sufficient and should display the readings and update every 0.5 seconds as specified during the design phase.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unit can now be left to do its thing. The expected time before the battery gives out is approximately 2 weeks. But using intermittently seems more practical. For example, when you need to demonstrate to high school children or when you&rsquo;re about to find out what kind of clothes to wear to work in the morning and then just turning it off. This will help save electricity at home by not running a smart device or TV but also save the battery life of the 9V attached to the Temperature and humidity monitor.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monitor is simple, cheap and quick to build. Its creative enough to engage young minds but not insanely difficult and laborious that it&rsquo;ll mate them lose interest. It is also practical and not a waste of resources and time as it does something to show useful information that can be used in a meaningful way.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Tools and Technology:</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tools required for this is Arduino nano microprocessor, 9V battery, temperature and humidity sensors, wires, bread board and LCD unit for display. The team will also require a computer capable enough to run small-scale programming software such as the Arduino IDE where the code for the project will be written. Finally, a guide to use these electrical components is needed, which can be found by using the internet and some knowledge of how to use the Arduino Ide which can also be learnt quickly using the internet. All the components needed are relatively inexpensive and the software is free to download from the Arduino&rsquo;s official website.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Skills required:</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be able to successfully complete this project, the team will require some understanding of how some of these electrical components work. The team will not be required to have an understanding of how these electrical components are modelled or how the internals of these work but simply know which leads connects to which terminals and what each of the terminals on the microprocessor do; mostly for safety reasons in order to protect both the individual working and also the electrical components. Furthermore, the team will need to know how to code on the Arduino IDE in order to command the microprocessor to conduct its task. Most importantly the team will require the skills to learn a few different but simple concepts and methodology to complete this project.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Outcome:</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the project is successful, I&rsquo;d expect more schools to hear about this interactive and fun engagement from university students with high school students who might become the future of the technology. We expect as a direct result of our engagement more students are considering careers in Information technology or one of the engineering fields. At the very least, we expect students who were unsure about what they wanted to do after school to be inspired by our interactive activity and start thinking about what to do with their careers, this would mean that we have achieved success but also means that more of such projects need to be conducted to help with our future.</span></p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>A little about Alessio</strong></h3>
    <center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alessio-Rigoli/A2-Team-Project/master/img/Alessio.png"></center>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student ID:</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> s3775600</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My name is Alessio and I have a background in the I.T industry working as a helpdesk technician dealing with a range of systems including Windows, macOS, Linux as well as Android and iOS. I originally got my start back at high school where I first learnt about jailbreaking my iPod touch and later learning to gain root access to my old Android phone which led me to various forums and websites where I learnt about custom firmware, custom ROM images and later Linux and open source. </span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After my first few years of high school I started to become really interested in other aspects of the technology including software, blogging, security and around this time launched my website</span><a href="https://agrtech.com.au/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">agrtech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date my education includes successful completion of primary school between 2005-2012 and high school between 2012-2017 and currently studying Introduction to I.T with RMIT university. My family heritage is Italian and in terms of languages I can speak some Italian. My hobbies include reading, watching movies, reading books, blogging and playing table tennis, which is my favourite sport to play and spending time with our 2 family Labrador's named Max and Ruby.</span></p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>A little about Anton</strong></h3>
    <center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alessio-Rigoli/A2-Team-Project/master/img/Anton.png"></center>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student ID:</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> s3804317</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My name is ANTON TRAN, I was born in 1977, HO CHI MINH City, VIETNAM. Vietnam, Bali, Thailand are in the top destinations attracting most Australians and Europeans. I studied engineering in Vietnam university, during the time at university, I found it was too hard for me to complete that degree, because I studied that it was huge disadvantage for local students to learn all very old formulas from Soviet Communist Science to compare with all new technology, science from Western.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1999, and then I decided to go to Australia to get another opportunity to watch and study how Western people could achieve so many brilliant things of IT, science, medicine, law.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was in high-school, I have learned programming by Pascal and Fox language. It was running on MS-DOS, it was complicated in my studying time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Since 2006, I have been working as an accountant accounting for five years. My&nbsp; job was to look after payroll and banking reconciliation. Then I have been working in logistic industry for 8 years. I am keep studying to move forward to get more challenges in the financial field.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am currently studying for a Degree in Applied Finance at RMIT, and IT is a very important subject for finance, because I would like to work in the stock market, that is the only the most powerful tool to access all information of companies, international markets.</span></p>
    <br></br>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>A little about Vignesh</strong></h3>
    <center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alessio-Rigoli/A2-Team-Project/master/img/Vignesh.png"></center>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student ID: </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">s3826714</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;m an Australian from an Indian background so my culture is a blend between both Australian and Indian. I have lived in this country for 10+ years and completed the majority of my high school education in Melbourne. I also did my bachelor&rsquo;s in science (Electrical Systems) at the University of Melbourne but unfortunately due to work commitments I had to drop the course in my final semester. After my course, I joined the Australian Defence Force and I have been working in the Army for almost 2 years now. </span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coming from an Indian background, my family and I are very adaptable, our culture brings a vibrancy to our lives and people around us by the flashy Bollywood movies, music, and our food which also brings families together. So overall, my Indian culture brings the adaptable, interesting and caring side of my character whereas the Australian culture that I have been accustomed to in recent years brings out the mateship, confidence and independent individual I have become.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my spare time, I like to explore vast variety of things such as scuba diving, playing sports such as soccer, badminton and swimming. I am also very fond of riding motorcycles which has become the latest of my favourite past times after I got my licence recently and these summer months really allows me to do all the things I love.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My interest in Information Technology began when I was doing my first bachelors which involved some coding as fundamentals for Electrical Engineering. Initially IT was forced on to me although I disliked it very much purely because coming from an Indian social circle, many of my mates and my family friends were in the IT field and I really didn&rsquo;t like what they did for a living. But soon I came to realise that IT is everywhere and it's everything. It&rsquo;s innovation, its creation and its history. Let me explain&hellip; IT allows you to make progress in leaps and bounds relative to anything we have seen in the past, creating things we only dreamt of in the past &ndash; MRI machines, Virtual reality, smart home systems like in Iron Man movies. </span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a direct result of the things we have learned throughout history which is leading our drive towards innovation and the freedom we have allows us to create whatever our heart desires. This brought out a whole new perspective in me &ndash; to be in the leading edge of innovation, if not at least be up to date with the latest trends and technology &ndash; move forward with the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My experiences with IT are adequate &ndash; I have done courses in C; Java and I have self-taught VBA and python. I have also used Verilog which is a hardware description language used in my previous degree.</span></p>

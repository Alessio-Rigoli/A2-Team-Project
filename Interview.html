    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>IT Work - Interview IT Professional</strong></h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Interview with Bala (Senior Systems and Network Administrator at WBP Group)</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For my interview I spoke with Bala who is the Senior Systems and Network Administrator at WBP Group in Melbourne and we discussed his role and challenges he faces in day to day job.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IT professional that was interviewed is a Senior Systems and Network Administrator at WBP Group, Melbourne. WBP Group is a private organisation that employs real estate professionals that conduct commercial and residential property valuations and provide expert advice to potential buyers and sellers as an external third party across the nation. </span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the IT professional, the areas that he works in are server and systems rollout for the websites and databases for WBP group, conducts regular administration task and maintenance of the servers and national network infrastructure. </span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among his routine tasks that were mentioned above, he also conducts network design and planning, including management of network capability and sorting out existing data on the servers to provide space and availability to new data.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are there other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a daily basis, this IT professional interacts with other members of his team of IT technicians and systems administrators, which he leads. Having worked in the industry for almost 18 years and in this company for 12 years, he has had to interact with many types of people &ndash; both clients and the external staff that he comes into contact when a particular task requires experts outside his limits. For example, the clients that he serves are the real estate professionals employed within the WBP group as well as the management. The real estate professionals require him to do mostly admin related tasks such as password recovery, file transfers, backup and imaging, space allocation on the servers and reconfiguration of the network and servers when something goes wrong being some of the routine tasks that he has to conduct for them.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Being a senior member of the WBP group in Melbourne from the IT side of the house, he is required to also do task the management assigns him which can range from simple tasks such as adding additional servers to full blown projects which need to be properly lead and complete. The recent project was a full upgrade of the interface used by the real estate evaluators during the day to day tasks at the Melbourne branch. </span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, the IT professional has to also interact with the external staff as he outsources tasks which are outside the scope of his expertise. Recent interactions with external staff include the electrical technician/ engineer that came to test and sign off on some of the computer and server power management cables to ensure they meet the industry requirements and up to the safety standards, which he mentioned is a yearly interaction. </span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the IT professional does interact with the general public, it remains rare as the IT team is an in-house group of professionals that supports the real estate valuators and advisors that in turn interact with the general public regularly.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IT professional that was interviewed spends most of his time at the WBP offices in Melbourne. As he describes it, it&rsquo;s mostly a desk-based job and most of the movement occurs when he has to assist his clients within the office spaces. </span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also sometimes chooses to go with his real estate valuators to sites purely for professional curiosity. And on other occasions he likes to visit external IT companies which have usual dealings with his firm in order to maintain relations. </span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But according to the IT professional he only does this about 10% of the time. In addition to the work requirements, the IT professional is also provided with a small gym within the site offices which he chooses to utilise in order to recuperate and recharge which helps him get his mind off work for a while and in turn when he is actually at work increases productivity.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the IT professional there are several aspects he finds challenging. Firstly, the long hours that he has to sometimes put in due to the seniority and the workload during major projects affects his personal life with his family. </span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a father, working on weekends and working extended hours really brings down his morale and frustrating to not spend enough time at home as he hopes from previous jobs he has done in the past. Secondly, the diversity in the task that he has conduct on a daily basis keeps him on his toes and also allows him to stand skilled in the most of the tasks he is trained to do. </span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the most challenging aspect as described by the IT professional is leading a group of different minded individuals but at the same time being able to continue doing his own task at the same standards that was previously set is challenging. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He describes that firm expects great deal from him, as it should and has every right but takes the toll on him sometimes. </span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, bringing the groups of 7 or sometimes 8 onto the same page and ensuring that they do their job to the same standards is one of the most challenging things the IT professional has had to do.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Interview with Evan (I.T Manager at local high school)</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For my interview I spoke with Evan who is the I.T manager at a local high school in Shepparton and discussed his role and challenges he faces in day to day jobs.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What kind of work is done by the I.T professional?</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being the I.T manager Evan primarily deals with core infrastructure across the network including hypervisors, switches, virtual machines and data systems such as SAN&rsquo;s backup and archiving hardware and software. He is also involved in the long-term planning of I.T and ensures that systems are maintained and upgraded as needed during their lifecycle. </span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evan also performs managerial tasks such as allocating jobs to other members of the I.T team and co-ordinating various projects such as new installations, migrations or upgrade tasks.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What kinds of people does the I.T professional interact with? Are they other I.T professionals? Clients? Investors? General public?</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the course of his work Evan primarily deals with the management hierarchy of the school including the principal, business manager and vice principals. In addition to working with the school leadership he also works with various hardware and software vendors and the other technicians in the team to coordinate projects and manage day to day tasks. </span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other people he works with include teachers and the e-learning committee to work out the best way to integrate I.T into classroom activities. Lastly he also works with the department of education to resolve technical issues and get information on new network changes.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Where does the I.T professional spend most of their time?</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the time this I.T professional spends his time in the I.T office where he monitors infrastructure and managing all aspects of I.T operations. He also spends a large portion of his time in the administration office with the school hierarchy.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest challenge this professional faces is coordinating the entire team to ensure everything stays on track and running smoothly. Another challenge is to stay up-to-date and relevant constantly with new hardware and software developments. </span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to this new patches, security vulnerabilities and upgrades are constantly being rolled out which can be hard to keep on top of.</span></p>

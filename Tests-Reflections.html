    <h2><strong>Test results/reflection</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Anton&lsquo;s profiles:</strong></h3>
<p>Results from Myers-Briggs Test:</p>

<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Efficient &ndash; Commanders see inefficiency not just as a problem in its own right, but as something that pulls time and energy away from all their future goals, an elaborate sabotage consisting of irrationality and laziness. People with the Commander personality type will root out such behavior wherever they go.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Strategic Thinkers &ndash; Commanders exemplify the difference between moment-to-moment crisis management and navigating the challenges and steps of a bigger plan, and are known for examining every angle of a problem and not just resolving momentary issues, but moving the whole project forward with their solutions.</span></span></p>
<h3 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Conclusion:</strong></span></span></h3>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Commanders are natural-born leaders. People with this personality type embody the gifts of charisma and confidence, and project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. However, Commanders are also characterized by an often ruthless level of rationality, using their drive, determination and sharp minds to achieve whatever end they&rsquo;ve set for themselves. Perhaps it is best that they make up only three percent of the population, lest they overwhelm the more timid and sensitive personality types that make up much of the rest of the world &ndash; but we have Commanders to thank for many of the businesses and institutions we take for granted every day.</span></span></p>

    <center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alessio-Rigoli/A2-Team-Project/master/img/TestResults/Anton/AntonEducationPlanner.png" style="width: 50%; height: 50%"></center>
    <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Test results/reflection</strong></span></span></p>
<h3 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>What does the test mean to myself?</strong></span></span></h3>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">It is the guides that I could review on my strengths and weaknesses. It is not always reliable methods, whatever you are studying, the most impressive lessons are experienced by practical works on it. The conditional environment, numbers in group of people, size of projects, working hard are also relevant factors contributing to the various results of working or studying.</span></span></p>
<h3 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>How do I think these results would affect the team?</strong></span></span></h3>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I think the results are toward to individual more than to a group. Whenever the teamwork is established. The leader will be concerned by referendum or expertise of individual skills.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</strong></span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In any circumstances, the game rules should be flexible with various team formation. Team is interesting environment for discussion about the strategic planning. Team is required the best ideal of inventions and recruit an excellent team leader who has the ability to manage all the weakness into the powerful team. The individual contributions are scrutiny listened and examined before executing the action plan.</span></span></p>

    <h3 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Reflection on the Group&rsquo;s profile:</strong></span></span></h3>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So initially there were 3 individual profiles in assignment 1, now putting them side to side, we can observe the similarities and differences we all have. There are things like strategic thinking and similar ways that we all learn by visual and auditory means which help us work well with each other. But there are some things like the way in which we all interact and perceive each other opinions and ideas which can cause friction but at the same time if we all had the same ideas there wouldn&rsquo;t really be real growth or innovation. So in some ways, the differences also help make a better team maybe more than the similarities.</span></span></p>

<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">On completion of the Myers Brigg test I ended up been ranked as "The Thinker" which is described as INTP (Introverted, intuitive, thinking and perceiving) I have included a screenshot below.</span></span></p>

<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">For the third choice I decided to complete the W3Schools HTML test with the results embedded below.</span></span></p>
<center><img src="https://github.com/Alessio-Rigoli/A2-Team-Project/blob/master/img/TestResults/Alessio/W3SchoolsHTML_Test_Results.png"></center>
    <h3 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</strong></span></span></h3>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Based on all 3 of these personality and quiz tests I think they have helped me to better identify my strengths and shortcomings when it comes to working and applying ideas to projects. I also believe it helped me to identify my specific learning style and what helps me to perform my best in different situations.</span></span></p>
<h3 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</strong></span></span></h3>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In a team environment, I believe the results would influence my behaviour by being more aware of my learning style and ways I can absorb information more effectively when learning new concepts which for me is very visual. Based on this I could take notes that include annotations or quick sketches of ideas to refer to them later.</span></span></p>
<h3 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</strong></span></span></h3>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In terms of a team environment I think these tests would assist me with identifying the appropriate position for me to take as well as position others in the team according to their strengths and learning styles to ensure they can work at the optimum level and are able to work more effectively together as a team.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I think these insights would also help to ensure that I can apply continuous improvement to improve my shortcomings in my work such as by setting manageable deadlines and timelines as well as staying focused and not taking on too many things.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I also believe this is beneficial for personal development over the long term and helping others in a team environment to achieve their goals and aspirations over time as well.</span></span></p>

    <h2>Group reflections</h2>
<h3><strong>Alessio&rsquo;s Reflection:</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite getting off to a rocky start with this project I have found both Anton and Vignesh to be really great to work with. Initially we ran into issues with communication mostly due to our different locations and hence different schedules. Eventually once we were able to get together we began breaking up the assessment into logical pieces and all took leadership to finalize our parts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we had established a clear and concise plan we were able to execute everything relatively quickly and split the workload. I think the shortcoming of our group was the initial barrier of communication and uncertainty of the group which delayed our progress at the start. Another hurdle we initially faced was with choosing an ideal platform to collaborate and start work which was later solved when we decided to stick to basics and use Google docs and Facebook messenger as we all had access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I learned a bit more about the other members of the group and enjoyed working with them and found we had complimenting skills. Lastly I was surprised of how we were able to come together in a short space of time and rapidly work together to complete this project. I look forward to more group work going forward with Anton and Vignesh and the other tasks in this course.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Anton&rsquo;s Reflection:</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, in the last minute we were notified by admin the team has missed one member, now we only have 3 people in our group, it could be harder for us if we are missing one of the best contributions to our assignment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Vignesh and Alessio has great experience in the IT industry, our problems have been solved in beyond expectation, we have been discussing our project and bring out the best ideas to complete the group assignment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is the big goal for all of us to focus on and work closely together to understand each other&rsquo;s IT skills. Honestly, I am very fortunate to cooperate with these very special members and we are looking forward to achieve the best results and the most enjoyable time for studying IT.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Vignesh&rsquo;s Reflection:</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe that both Alessio and Anton were great team members. They contributed their side of the personal information/profile as well as pulled their weight when it came to doing the shared parts of the assignment. The things that worked well were rather than the team just piecing together bits of the assignment and submitting it. We all did our share then collaborated and cross-checked the work on google docs to make sure that we did the best we could. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The things that didn&rsquo;t work so well were lack of constant communication which could be because we had different schedules and personal commitments. Finally, we hope to take forward what worked and hopefully introduce more methods that&rsquo;ll help us with the assignments and to improve our communications we just have to set more time and plan ahead to accommodate everyone&rsquo;s needs.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Overall Group Reflection:</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This group had some setbacks as the team was halved when some of the members chose to leave the course/subject but despite that the group worked really well with each other. Although we had difficulty initially setting up a consistent means of communications and basically used RMIT&rsquo;s canvas emails to communicate with each other which resulted in response from the team members either a day or two later, really slowed our progress but we persisted and the only thing that kept each of us going were our team spirit and motivation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being an introductory course, most of the team were new to online study methods and collaboration which meant the communication isn&rsquo;t as efficient or to the level required in order to properly share all of our ideas and thoughts on the project and assignment in general. In order to combat this, the group decided to use simple methods of communications such as facebook or just simple messenger applications and google docs which allowed for increased productivity; allowing us to complete this assignment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For future assignments with this group, the recommendations across the board were starting a little earlier which will give us more time to proof-read and give the assignment final touches to further improve the presentation and general material quality. We wish to continue using simple means of communications and document sharing means in the future assignments to keep things basic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most surprising thing that we discovered was that as the university is in Melbourne, one of us lives in Toowoomba, one in country Victoria and the other from Sydney which gave us major doubts about our ability to complete a group based assignment. But as ironic as it may be this introduction to information technology has really shown all of us that for today&rsquo;s technology long distance means absolutely nothing if we stay determined to complete the task. So, this team's capability has been the most pleasant surprise to us all.</span></p>

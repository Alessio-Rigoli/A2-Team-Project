    <h2><strong>Ideal Jobs</strong></h2>
    <p><center><strong>Alessio&rsquo;s ideal job:</strong></p></center>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alessio-Rigoli/A2-Team-Project/master/img/AlessioJobListing.jpeg"style="width: 50%; height: 50%"></center>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Job/Role: Owner of technology business</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My ideal job is to be able to run a technology based business specialized in websites and software building a handful of applications and websites each with their own user base able to cater to different needs from different users.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I find the idea of building and running a business appealing due to the sense of achievement and creative freedom allowing me to express my ideas and pursue ideas I am passionate about.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also enjoy the process of building a brand from the idea to marketing and communicating my message to like-minded individuals and working with really talented and interesting people makes me feel very satisfied with my work.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly this position entails the following:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Develop and maintain an I.T strategy</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Ensure targeted budgets are met and financials remain on target and profitable</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Ensure uptime of all infrastructure and internal systems</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Work with various vendors and partners to collaborate and form strategic business partnerships</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Manage all aspects of HR including recruitment, training and coaching of staff</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Description (skills, experience and qualifications):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my opinion this position entails many things including the following skills:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Finance: Paying bills, managing money and investments as well as forecasting for future events and organizing money accordingly to ensure everything is paid for to avoid debt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Stress management: I think this is an important aspect of business as difficult times will always come up and managing it is crucial to stay on top of issues and difficult situations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Marketing/sales: To be able to sell your product or service and communicate brand values to customers as well as maintain relationships.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Industry knowledge: This role will require knowledge and experience of the technology/I.T industry including standard protocols, software and hardware used as well as challenges and opportunities in the industry required to always stay up-to-date.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Qualifications &amp; courses that may help:</strong></p>
<ol style="text-align: center;">
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bachelor of marketing</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bachelor of I.T</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bookkeeping course</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduction to business management concepts (Course available within the Bachelor of I.T)</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Experience I currently have:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Some technical experience and ideas of the I.T industry</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Experience with online marketing</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Experience with working in customer support</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Plan on how I will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to meet the required skills for this role I will need to broaden my experience of marketing which could include the following areas of study and or practical experiences:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Customer acquisition and retention</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Sales funnels</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Paid advertising and social media marketing</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Complete the Introduction to business management course to get an improved insight to management practices including the above HR requirements.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to achieve these goals I would start by applying for the 2 courses:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Introduction to business management</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Introduction to bookkeeping</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>My plan:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow some online courses and blogs to learn more about paid advertising and social media which can be applied on smaller test projects before eventually been utilised to their full extent.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Discuss my objectives with a mentor which can help me to improve my processes and address any shortcomings I discover over time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Continue to meet new people and learn from books, blogs, forums and through professional networking events to ensure I am constantly improving my skills.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Look at other short courses to improve my core skills such as cyber security, finance &amp; human resources.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the above steps I believe I can acquire the relevant skills to begin working in a starting role to further gain the relevant experiences before being able to eventually climb the corporate ladder to a management role and or eventually form my own business.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Vignesh&rsquo;s Ideal Job:</strong></h2>
<center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alessio-Rigoli/A2-Team-Project/master/img/VigneshJobListing.png"style="width: 50%; height: 50%">
<h3><strong>My Plan:</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I plan to complete my Bachelor&rsquo;s in Information Technology in the next few years and then continue my study and complete Master&rsquo;s in Cyber Security. Then along with my experience in Defence try and seek a job in the private sector as a junior cyber analyst or continue with defence and work as a cyber security analyst. Then as I gain experience, I&rsquo;d like to move up the ranks and finally get to my ideal job as a senior cyber security manager at a firm. I&rsquo;d also plan to get certified in the risk management frameworks and various other minor certifications, also completed various professional development or leadership courses/seminars along with ways to boost my change of being considered for a senior management position such as the one I have mentioned above.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Anton&rsquo;s Ideal Job:</strong></h2>
    <center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alessio-Rigoli/A2-Team-Project/master/img/AntonJobListing1.png"style="width: 50%; height: 50%"></center>
    <center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alessio-Rigoli/A2-Team-Project/master/img/AntonJobListing2.png"style="width: 50%; height: 50%"></center>
    <center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alessio-Rigoli/A2-Team-Project/master/img/AntonJobListing3.png"style="width: 50%; height: 50%"></center>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Plan to be successful candidate:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Graduate Bachelor's Degree in Finance or Economics.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- I will be looking for work experience in financial sectors, expertise in share trading, CFDs trading, managed funds, property tradings, financial banking, financial planner, risk management.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Keep working closely to share market, international market, assists with tax law, maintaining the financial statement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Self researching and planning for financial project in short-term and long-term strategy.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Comparison&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone has different jobs as each individual has different experiences, hopes and goals. Alessio has a business focus, Vignesh has a management focus and Anton wants to work in finance which is what he is studying and doing this subject as he is interested in AI and robots and hope it might broaden his knowledge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As expected the job requirements are also vastly different for these roles as the jobs are different. All of them require experience in the chosen field but Alessio&rsquo;s role requires more business and IT related qualification and experience. Vignesh&rsquo;s Job needs cyber security skills and qualification and experience in that industry to get to the management level. Anton&rsquo;s degree and experience needs are in the financial sector where he wants to become a graduate trader.</span></p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>User log</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Note:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The github page creation was assigned to Alessio, hence there wasn&rsquo;t much point putting the log from github. Instead the google docs log was shared where we all worked on the assignment together.</span></p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Industry data</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What are the job titles for your groups ideal jobs? How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers?</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Alessio: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Owner of technology/software business</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Anton: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graduate trader</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Vignesh:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senior manager of cyber security</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on all the Burning glass data all our jobs collectively had elements that were in high demand by employers however all of our specific job titles didn&rsquo;t rank significantly high with the highest ranking job title been a cyber security analyst and software developer. Some of the elements we all shared however included some of the following elements:</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Networking &amp; system administration</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Computer operator roles</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Business intelligence for working with data in order to make better decisions.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>From your groups ideal jobs, you can identify a set of skills required for these jobs (we will refer to this as your groups required skill set). These can be divided into general skills (communication, problem solving, writing etc) and IT-specific skills (JavaScript, SQL, etc).</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on all the teams ideal jobs they rank moderately with some elements of skills been present whilst the majority of higher ranking skills weren&rsquo;t present. Some of the skills that were present across all our jobs and highly ranked in this data set included the following:</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Microsoft Windows </span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Building relationships </span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Microsoft office </span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Project management</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from the above IT-specific skills the vast majority of our skill sets relevant to our ideal jobs were outside this range.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on all the general skills laid out in this data set our required skill sets for our ideal jobs ranked really high with the following skills been paramount to our chosen jobs:</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Problem solving </span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Communication </span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Organisational skills </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teamwork/collaboration </span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these attributes are in high demand from employers in various industries and would be a large part of our work in numerous situations.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What are the three highest ranked IT-Specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the burning glass data the biggest IT-specific skill that was missing from all our ideal jobs and experiences was SQL for working with databases. The second highest IT-Specific skill based on the data set which was also missing from our skill sets was Javascript which none of the team was proficient in. Lastly, another highly ranked skill the team wasn&rsquo;t experienced with was the SAP software environment used by many businesses for record management and human resources activities.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of general skills the three highest ranking skills that were lacking from all our individual profiles included the following:</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Analytics </span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Mentoring </span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Quality assurance and control </span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a team we identified the above areas were we lack the experience with our current skill sets while the higher ranking skills were closely aligned with our ideal jobs and collectively we believe that we possess these skills.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon analysis of the Burning Glass data our opinions of our ideal jobs mostly remained the same primarily due to the fact that these were areas we felt passionate about and had knowledge about. Other reasons for this consensus was due to the flexible and varied nature of I.T where a vast array of skills and technologies can be applied to different job roles and industries making our choices somewhat flexible to adapt as needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
